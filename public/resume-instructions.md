# QA Portfolio - Resume Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for your resume. 

To use:
1. Create your resume PDF
2. Name it `resume.pdf`
3. Place it in the `/public` folder
4. The download link in the navigation will work automatically

The navigation bar already has a "Resume" button that will download `/public/resume.pdf` when clicked.
